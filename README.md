# Interview-Repo

To run this on your local computer, the following are the requirements:

1) You can run :
        git clone https://github.com/guptaru1/Interview-Repo.git

2) Navigate to the folder "Server" and run "npm start". This gets our server up and running for the two api's:

      /path: called on inital page load
      /path/MYPATH: called when user clicks on a folder to reveal it's contents
      
3) Navigate to the folder "Client" and run "npm start" in another terminal. This gets our front-end running to visualise the folder contents
